Despite the multiple advantages of CVL (orthogonal variability, architecture variability resolution, MOF-compliant, standard proposed,...), several approaches require extending and/or modifying the CVL approach in different ways in order to fulfill the industrial needs for variability modeling in Software Product Lines. However, the community lacks a tool that would enable proposed extensions and the integration of novel approaches to be put into practice. Existing tools that provide support for CVL are incomplete or are mainly focused on the variability model's editor, instead of executing the resolution of the variability over the base models. Moreover, there is no API that allows direct interaction with the CVL engine to extend or use it in an independent application. In this paper, we identify the extension points of the CVL approach with the goal of making the CVL engine more flexible, and to help software architects in the task of resolving the variability of their products. The practical tool presented here is a working implementation of the CVL engine, that can be extended through a proposed API.},

This paper proposes a solution to help the software architect to generate configurations of FQAs whilst keeping the energy consumed by the application as low as possible. For this, a usage model is defined for each FQA, taking into account the variables that affect the energy consumption, and that the values of these variables change according to the part of the application where the FQA is required. We extend a Software Product Line that models a family of FQAs to incorporate the variability of the usage model and the existing frameworks that implement FQAs. We generate the most eco-efficient configuration of FQAs by selecting the framework with the most suitable characteristics according to the requirements of the application.},

INTER-TRUST is a framework for the specification, negotiation, deployment and dynamic adaptation of interoperable security policies, in the context of pervasive systems where devices are constantly exchanging critical information through the network. The dynamic adaptation of the security policies at runtime is addressed using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) that allows enforcing security requirements by dynamically weaving security aspects into the applications. However, a mechanism to guarantee the correct adaptation of the functionality that enforces the changing security policies is needed. In this paper, we present an approach based on the combination of monitoring and detection techniques in order to maintain the correlation between the security policies and the associated functionality deployed using AOP, allowing the INTER-TRUST framework to automatically react when needed.},

Applications may require different FQAs, and each FQA (e.g., security) can be composed of many concerns (e.g., access control or authentication). They normally have dependencies between them and crosscut the system architecture. The goal of the work presented here is to provide the means for software architects to focus only on application functionality, without having to worry about FQAs. The idea is to model FQAs separately from application functionality following a Software Product Line (SPL) approach. By combining SPL and aspect-oriented mechanisms, we will define a generic process to model and automatically inject FQAs into the application without breaking the base architecture. We will provide and compare two implementations of our generic approach using different variability and architecture description languages: (i) feature models and an aspect-oriented architecture description language; and (ii) the Common Variability Language (CVL) and a MOF-compliant language (e.g., UML). We also discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach. Modelling FQAs separately from the base application has many advantages (e.g., reusability, less coupled components, high cohesive architectures).},

  abstract     = {Los atributos de calidad funcionales (FQA) son aquellos que tienen una clara implicación en la funcionalidad del sistema, es decir, existen unos componentes específicos que deben ser incorporados a la arquitectura software del sistema para satisfacer sus requisitos de atributos de calidad. Ejemplos de FQAs son seguridad, usabilidad, o persistencia. Modelar estos atributos es una tarea compleja. Por un lado, se componen de muchas características relacionadas, por ejemplo seguridad está compuesto, entre otros, por autenticación, confidencialidad y encriptación. Tienen dependencias entre ellos, por ejemplo, seguridad puede ser requerido por usabilidad o persistencia. Por otro lado, tienen muchos puntos de variabilidad: una aplicación concreta puede requerir autenticación y control de acceso mientras que otra puede necesitar sólo encriptación. Además, su funcionalidad suele estar dispersa afectando a varios componentes del sistema en desarrollo. El objetivo de esta tesis es definir una línea de productos software orientada a aspectos que permita: (1) modelar las similitudes y la variabilidad de los FQAs desde las primeras etapas del proceso de desarrollo, (2) gestionar las dependencias existentes entre los FQAs, (3) independizar el modelado de los FQAs de la arquitectura de la aplicación afectada, (4) configurar los FQAs en base a los requisitos de cada aplicación teniendo además en cuenta propiedades no funcionales como el rendimiento y el consumo energético de cada solución, (5) incorporar las configuraciones a la arquitectura de la aplicación de manera automática; y (6) gestionar la evolución de los FQAs cuando los requisitos cambien en el futuro. Como resultado se ha definido WeaFQAs, un proceso software para gestionar los FQAs que cubre todos los puntos mencionados. Se han realizado y comparado dos instanciaciones de WeaFQAs usando diferentes lenguajes de variabilidad y de modelado, además de proporcionar soporte con una herramienta basada en el lenguaje CVL. },

  abstract     = {There are some Quality Attributes (QAs) whose variability is addressed through functional variability in the software architecture. Separately modelling the variability of these QAs from the variability of the base functionality of the application has many advantages (e.g., a better reusability), and facilitates the reconfiguration of the QA variants at runtime. Many factors may vary the QA functionality: variations in the user preferences and usage needs; variations in the non-functional QAs; variations in resources, hardware, or even in the functionality of the base application, that directly affect the product's QAs. In this paper, we aim to elicit the relationships and dependencies between the functionalities required to satisfy the QAs and all those factors that can provoke a reconfiguration of the software architecture at runtime. We follow an approach in which the variability of the QAs is modelled separately from the base application functionality, and propose a dynamic approach to reconfigure the software architecture based on those reconfiguration criteria.},

  abstract     = {The quality of a software system can be measured by the extent to which it possesses a desired combination of quality attributes (QAs). While some QAs are achieved implicitly through the interaction of various functional components of the system, others (e.g., security) can be encapsulated in dedicated software components. These QAs are known as functional quality attributes (FQAs). As applications may require different FQAs, and each FQA can be composed of many concerns (e.g., access control and authentication), integrating FQAs is very complex and requires dedicated expertise. Software architects are required to manually define FQA components, identify appropriate points in their architecture where to weave them, and verify that the composition of these FQA components with the other components is correct. This is a complex and error prone process. In our previous work we defined reusable FQAs by encapsulating them as aspectual architecture models that can be woven into a base architecture. So far, the joinpoints for weaving had to be identified manually. This made it difficult for software architects to verify that they have woven all the necessary FQAs into all the right places. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a notion of contract for FQAs so that the correct application of an FQA (or one of its concerns) can be checked or, alternatively, appropriate binding points can be identified and proposed to the software architect automatically.},

A developer can improve the application's delivery and productivity by following a multi tenancy approach, where variants of the same application can be quickly customized to the necessities of each tenant. However, managing the inherent variability existing in multi-tenant applications and, even more importantly, managing the evolution of a multi-tenant application with hundreds of tenants and thousands of different valid architectural configurations can become intractable if performed manually. In this paper we propose a product line architecture approach in which: (1) we use cardinality-based variability models to model each tenant as a clonable feature, (2) we automate the process of evolving the multi- tenant application architecture, and (3) we demonstrate that the implemented process is correct and efficient for a high number of tenants in a reasonable time. We use a running case study in the domain of medical software.},

  abstract     = {One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in the virtual world of the Internet. One property that characterises IoT systems is that they have to react to variable and continuous changes. This means that IoT systems need to work as self-managed systems to effectively manage context changes. The autonomy property inherent to software agents makes them a suitable choice for developing self-managed IoT systems. By embedding agents in the devices that compose the IoT is possible to realize a decentralized system with self-management capacities. However, in this scenario new problems arise. Firstly, current agent development approaches lack mechanisms to deal with the heterogeneity present in the IoT domain. Secondly, agents must simultaneously deal with potentially conflicting changes in their behaviour, concerning self-management and application goals. In order to afford these challenges we propose to use an approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (D-SPL) and preference-based reasoning. The D-SPL provides to the preference-based reasoning of the agent with the necessary information to adapt its behaviour at runtime making a trade-off between the self-management of the system and the accomplishment of its application goals.},

Security properties (e.g., confidentiality, anonymity) need to be satisfied in different ways in different parts of the same application. Software architects are usually required to manually define security components and their dependencies with the base application, customize them to the application’s requirements, identify the points where security is incorporated, and verify that the selected places are correct. The last two steps are especially complex and error-prone. In our approach, we aim to provide a solution that helps software architects to identify the correct places to incorporate the security functionality and to verify the correctness of the composed application architecture. This is achieved by identifying a set of general structural patterns for incorporating security into the application architecture, and by providing a model-driven SPL solution to customize these patterns to each application’s requirements.},

  abstract     = {Providing security and privacy to wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) is very challenging, due to the heterogeneity of sensor nodes and their limited capabilities in terms of energy, processing power and memory. The applications for these systems run in a myriad of sensors with different low-level programming abstractions, limited capabilities and different routing protocols. This means that applications for WSNs need mechanisms for self-adaptation and for self-protection based on the dynamic adaptation of the algorithms used to provide security. Dynamic software product lines (DSPLs) allow managing both variability and dynamic software adaptation, so they can be considered a key technology in successfully developing self-protected WSN applications. In this paper, we propose a self-protection solution for WSNs based on the combination of the INTER-TRUST security framework (a solution for the dynamic negotiation and deployment of security policies) and the FamiWare middleware (a DSPL approach to automatically configure and reconfigure instances of a middleware for WSNs). We evaluate our approach using a case study from the intelligent transportation system domain. },

  abstract     = {Quality attributes that add new behavior to the functional software architecture are known as functional quality attributes (FQAs). These FQAs are applied to pieces of software from small components to entire systems, usually crosscutting some of them. Due to this crosscutting nature, modeling them separately from the base application has many advantages (e.g. reusability, less coupled architectures). However, different applications may require different configurations of an FQA (e.g. different levels of security), so we need a language that: (i) easily expresses the variability of the FQAs at the architectural level; and that (ii) also facilitates the automatic generation of architectural configurations with custom-made FQAs. In this sense, the Common Variability Language (CVL) is extremely suited for use at the architectural level, not requiring the use of a particular architectural language to model base functional requirements. In this paper we propose a method based on CVL to: (i) model separately and generate FQAs customized to the application requirements; (ii) automatically inject customized FQA components into the architecture of the applications. We quantitatively evaluate our approach and discuss its benefits with a case study.},

In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of a runtime security adaptation service. This service is based on the combination of autonomic computing and aspect-oriented programming, where the security functionalities are implemented as aspects that are dynamically configured, deployed or un-deployed by generating and executing a security adaptation plan.

We propose a set of weaving patterns using model transformations in ATL to automatically weave the security concerns with the base application in an aspect-oriented way. Since different applications require different security requirements, the security model needs to be customized before its incorporation into the application. We resolve the variability of the security properties and implement the weaving process in CVL. We use an e-voting case study to illustrate our proposal using the CVL approach.},

The main goal of this paper is to close this gap. This is done by using the paradigms of Software Product Lines and Aspect-Oriented Programming in order to: (1) link the security policies with the security functionalities, (2) generate a configuration of the security functionalities that fit a security policy, and (3) weave the selected security functionalities into an application.

A running example will be used throughout the tutorial to illustrate how AOP works. The tutorial will principally illustrate the use of the AspectJ programming language, although other AOP languages will be used to cover features that are not included in AspectJ.
